# NearBy

Have you ever been in one of those situations where you or a group cannot decide where to eat? The NearBy Application is a solution for that! The NearBy application is an android app that will randomly select a restaurant for you within a desired radius.


The NearBy App is a practice with using APIs. In this case, I am utilizing Google Places API. 

UPDATE 9/24/2018:

I added the basic functionality where I am able to search for restaurants in a 10 mile radius. I will update it where I am going to have the user change the radius to their desired ones (Hopefully not too far since I can only have a certain number of requests =) ).



-Future Updates:
  Routes from your location to the randomly selected restaurant.
  Description of restaurant
